		<h2>Rating system</h2>

		<span class="smallbluetitle">Based on the rating system developed by Prof.</span>

		<p>
			Absolute rating system, the rating can be used to determine the winning odds of a specific
			player against another player. The system has been worked out according to
			statistical and probability theory.
			<br>
			The rating is an integer, the minimum is 0. The starting rate of an unknown player is 0.
		</p>

		<table class=n1>
			<tr>
				<th class="smallbluetitle n1">Rating difference</th>
				<th class="smallbluetitle n1">Win probability</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="normal n1">0</td>
				<td class="normal n1">0.50</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td class="normal n1">100</td>
				<td class="normal n1">0.64</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="normal n1">200</td>
				<td class="normal n1">0.76</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="normal n1">400</td>
				<td class="normal n1">0.91</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="normal n1">800</td>
				<td class="normal n1">0.99</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p> Ratings are amended each time you finish a game, by adding or subtracting an amount from your previous
			rating.
			The amount subtracted or added depends on the outcome of the game and the ratings of the two players
			involved.
		</p>
		<span class="smallorangetitle">Calculation</span>

		<p>The following formula is used:
			<br><span class="smallbluetitle">Rn = Ro + K(W-We)</span>
		<p class=sm>Rn is the new rating.
			<br>Ro the old (pre-event) rating.
			<br>K a constant (32 for 0-2099, 24 for 2100-2399, 16 for 2400 and above).
			<br>W the score in the event - i.e. for a single match win=1; draw=0.5; lose=0.
			<br>We the expected score (Win Expectancy), from the following formula:
			<br><span class=normal>We = 1/ (exp10(-dr/400) + 1)</span>

			<br>dr equals the difference in ratings.
		</p>
		<p>
			The sum of the
			rating changes is zero. It turns out that if the rating difference is more then
			719 points, then if the strong player wins, there is no change in either rating.
		</p>
		<span class="smallorangetitle">Provisional ratings (~)</span>

		<p>
			Players who have played less than 20 matches are considered to have "provisional" rating.
			This is indicated by a ~ sign next to their names.
			For these players their rating might not reflect their skill as precisely as for a player with "established"
			rating, therefore playing against a ~ player will have less effect on the other player's rating.
			The effect will grow gradually as the number of matches rise, and will reach normal level as the number of
			matches reaches 20.
		</p>


		<span class="smallorangetitle">Rating reduction</span>

		<p>
			Overall ratings are decreased each day by an amount depending on the current rating.<br>
			<br>The following formula is used:
			<br> Rn = ( Ro * Ro ) / 125000
			<span class=sm>

				<br>Rn is the new rating.
				<br>Ro the old (previous day) rating.
			</span>
		</p>
		<table class=n1>
			<tr>
				<th class="smallbluetitle n1">Rating</th>
				<th class="smallbluetitle n1">Amount subtracted</th>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td class="normal n1">below 353</td>
				<td class="normal n1">1</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="normal n1">354-500</td>
				<td class="normal n1">2</td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="normal n1">501-612</td>
				<td class="normal n1">3</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="normal n1">613-707</td>

				<td class="normal n1">4</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="normal n1">708-790</td>
				<td class="normal n1">5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>

				<td class="normal n1">791-866</td>
				<td class="normal n1">6</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="normal n1">867-935</td>
				<td class="normal n1">7</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td class="normal n1">936-1000</td>
				<td class="normal n1">8</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>
			So players with higher rating will see their rating decrease quicker.
			<br>A 500 rating will reach zero in approximately 1.5 years without playing.
		</p>

		<span class="smallorangetitle">Series of games</span>
		<p>
			Playing a series of games against the same opponent within a given
			time interval will adjust the calculation as follows:
			<br>The expected score is calculated for the series of games from the pre-match rating-difference of the two
			players,
			and the ratings are amended based on the expected score and the actual score of the series of games.
			<br>These are basically the extensions of the above calculation for more games played.
			<br>However, as more matches will reflect the skill difference more precisely, the amendment is raised based
			on the number of games played.
		</p>
		<table class=n1>
			<tr>
				<th class="smallbluetitle n1">Number of games in <br>a series of games</th>

				<th class="smallbluetitle n1">Maximum <br>rating change</th>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td class="normal n1">1</td>
				<td class="normal n1">16</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td class="normal n1">2</td>
				<td class="normal n1">24</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="normal n1">3</td>
				<td class="normal n1">28</td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="normal n1">4</td>
				<td class="normal n1">30</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="normal n1">5</td>

				<td class="normal n1">31</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="normal n1">infinite</td>
				<td class="normal n1">32</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>
			In other words the constant K in the above equations is multiplied by a factor of <span
				class=smalltitle>2-(1/2^(n-1))</span>, where n is the number of games played.
			<br><br>
			Note that if you play a 3rd player in between playing the same opponent, it will still be treated as a
			series of games.
